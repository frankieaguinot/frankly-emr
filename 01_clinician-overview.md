# Frankly EMR – Clinician Overview

Welcome to **Frankly EMR** — a new kind of health record system built by a doctor, for doctors.

It’s built on blockchain not because it’s trendy, but because it solves real problems:  
Who has access? When? For what reason? And can that access be verified and revoked?

## 🩺 Why It Matters to You

You shouldn't have to guess who else has touched a patient's record — or wait for faxed charts.

Frankly EMR gives you:

- ✅ Verified consent before access
- 🔍 A trail of who accessed what and why
- 🔄 Interoperability across hospitals, clinics, and borders
- 🧾 Assurance that your clicks and notes aren’t being used outside your intent

## 🧭 What’s Different About Frankly

Traditional EMRs:
- Treat data as institutional property
- Rely on static permissions
- Make it hard to audit access

Frankly EMR:
- Respects patient data ownership
- Uses consent-first smart contracts
- Logs every access attempt on an immutable ledger
- Works across systems — no matter where you or your patient are

---

## ⚙️ How It Works (Behind the Scenes)

- Patients grant consent using a simple UI
- You request access by selecting what you need (e.g., labs, imaging, notes)
- If granted, your access is logged permanently — not to spy, but to protect you
- If denied, the system respects the boundary and blocks the request

## 🧠 Designed for You

This isn’t some out-of-touch engineering experiment.  
It was built by someone who knows what it’s like to be on rounds, short on time, and navigating three different systems.

Frankly exists to:
- Reduce friction
- Restore patient trust
- Make medical data make sense again
