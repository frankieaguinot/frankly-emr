# Frankly EMR – Technical Documentation Overview

This folder contains technical and architectural documentation supporting the Frankly EMR system.

## Purpose

Frankly EMR was designed to prioritize **patient data sovereignty**, **end-to-end traceability**, and **interoperable transparency** from raw material sourcing through clinical use.

This documentation includes structural overviews, data flow models, permission logic, and implementation guidance to help engineers and healthtech builders adapt the system.

## Structure (To Be Expanded)

- `lifecycle-map.md` – overview of full-cycle data tracking from raw material to patient outcomes
- `consent-flows.md` – proposed UX and smart contract consent logic (coming soon)
- `api-map.md` – high-level layout of planned API endpoints and integrations (coming soon)
- `blockchain-logic.md` – overview of hash creation, permissioning, and audit trail triggers (coming soon)
