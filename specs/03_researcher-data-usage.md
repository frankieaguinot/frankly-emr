## Purpose
Enable ethically sound research using anonymized health data â€” boosting equity in global evidence-based medicine.

## Key Concepts
- **Anonymized, tokenized data access**.
- **Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs)** for eligibility criteria.
- **Opt-in by default; no data scraping.**

## Flow
1. Patient opts in to research data pool.
2. Researchers submit data query (e.g., looking for post-chemo outcomes in patients aged 60+).
3. Frankly uses smart contract to validate request, filter consented data only.
4. Results are delivered as de-identified, tokenized dataset.
5. Researchers cannot trace data back to individuals.
6. Patients may revoke participation at any time.

## Safeguards
- No export of raw identifiable data.
- All research queries and dataset deliveries are hashed.
- Researchers can be pre-accredited (via KYC/KYB or DAO governance).
