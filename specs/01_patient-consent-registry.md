# 01_patient-consent-registry.sol - Documentation

This smart contract governs patient-controlled consent within the Frankly EMR system.

Patients explicitly decide which providers can access their records. Consent is:

- Revocable: the patient can withdraw access anytime  
- Auditable: every action is hashed and logged  
- Scope-limited: tied to specific use cases via hashed descriptors

## 🧠 What This Contract Handles

- Patient-managed access permissions  
- Consent grant and revocation per provider  
- Scope control using hashed descriptors  
- Metadata references for off-chain data (IPFS, JSON, etc.)  
- Real-time access checks via `isPermitted()`  

This allows fine-grained control without exposing raw data, aligning with zero-trust principles and real-world flexibility.

## 🔐 Consent Flow

1. Patient is identified via DID (e.g., `did:franklyemr:123...`).  
2. Provider requests access.  
3. Patient grants consent through the interface, including:  
   - `scopeHash` (e.g., "lab results Jan-Mar 2023" hashed)  
   - Optional metadata URL or IPFS pointer  
4. System logs the event via blockchain hash.  
5. Provider can access only if:  
   - Scope matches  
   - Consent is still valid  
6. Patient may revoke consent anytime, instantly cutting access.

## 🌐 Decentralized Consent Control

In Frankly EMR, consent is not tied to a specific clinic or institution.  
It is tied to the patient and enforced by cryptographic logic.

This makes consent:

- Portable across hospitals  
- Durable across time  
- Traceable under audit  

This is particularly important in regions where doctors practice at multiple hospitals, such as the Philippines, ensuring providers do not lose access due to institutional silos.

## 📦 Function Reference

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `grantConsent(address grantee, bytes32 scopeHash, string metadata)` | Patient grants access to a provider |
| `revokeConsent(address grantee)` | Patient revokes previously granted access |
| `getConsent(address patient, address grantee)` | Returns the full consent record |
| `isPermitted(address patient, address grantee, bytes32 scopeHash)` | Checks if access is currently permitted |

All actions emit corresponding events for **on-chain logging and audit integrity**.

## 🧱 Real-World Analogy

This is like a digital permission slip folder:

- The patient fills out each consent form  
- They sign, date, and optionally attach supporting notes  
- If they tear up a slip, access is revoked, but the original entry is still on record
