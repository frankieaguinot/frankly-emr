# Lifecycle Tracking Map â€“ Frankly EMR

This document outlines the **end-to-end lifecycle structure** of the Frankly EMR system.

The design accounts for every stage of the pharmaceutical and clinical record chain, from sourcing raw materials to documenting excretion-related lab data.

## Stages of Lifecycle Tracking

1. **Raw Material Procurement**
   - Source identification, quality certifications
   - Hash generated at intake
   - DID-linked supplier signature

2. **Manufacturing & Packaging**
   - Batch tracking, timestamped environmental logs
   - Smart contract logs material-to-lot mapping
   - QA events hashed to block

3. **Supply Chain & Shipping**
   - Cold-chain compliance and handoff signatures
   - Chain-of-custody maintained via decentralized ledger

4. **Prescription & Dispensation**
   - Script logged with encrypted metadata
   - Pharmacist validation and dose matching via smart contract

5. **Clinical Use, Monitoring & Lab Testing**
   - Use logs, side-effect reporting, adherence tracking
   - Optional integration with AI pattern recognition
   - Results hashed, linked to treatment node

6. **Excretion & Downstream Monitoring**
   - Lab results tied to end-of-life tracking
   - Flag patterns indicating renal burden or off-target metabolism

## Technical Notes

- Each stage generates a **hash** to log the event immutably.
- Consent and access are managed through **smart contracts**.
- Patients hold their **private keys**, granting explicit access to providers.
- **Audit trails** are available per entry to ensure traceability and transparency.

This full cycle ensures ethical accountability, precision treatment, and the highest standard of trustless verification in patient health data.
