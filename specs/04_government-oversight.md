## Purpose
Allow public health agencies to monitor safety, access, and supply chain compliance â€” without compromising privacy.

## Key Concepts
- **Differential privacy** & aggregated reporting.
- **Regulatory audit trails** for controlled substances.
- **Decentralized transparency**.

## Flow
1. Regulator requests compliance check (e.g., Are Schedule IV prescriptions spiking?).
2. Frankly aggregates hashed logs of all relevant records.
3. Smart contracts enforce access scope (aggregate only; no PII).
4. Insights are delivered (e.g., 28% rise in Class IV scripts in Region 3).
5. No identifiable patient or provider data is revealed.

## Safeguards
- Only predefined queries allowed.
- Access limited to statistical data.
- Emergency oversight provision requires multisig approval (i.e., multiple authority keys).
