# Core System Architecture – Frankly EMR

This document outlines the **technical backbone** of Frankly — a blockchain-based electronic medical records (EMR) system designed for traceability, consent architecture, and global patient sovereignty.

## 🧱 Key Architectural Components

| Layer | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Frontend** | Physician & patient portal UI (web or app) |
| **Application Layer** | Business logic handling interactions between frontend and smart contracts |
| **Smart Contracts** | Modular role and consent governance:<br>• Actor role manager<br>• Patient consent registry<br>• Researcher usage logs<br>• Physician interaction records<br>• Government audit ledger |
| **Blockchain Layer** | Immutable ledger (e.g., Ethereum, Polygon, etc.) |
| **Off-chain Storage** | IPFS or encrypted cloud storage for bulky files (e.g., scans, images) |
| **Oracles** | Bridge between real-world data (lab results, insurance verification) and blockchain |

## 🔁 End-to-End Flow

1. **Patient logs in** using decentralized ID (DID) or secure credentials.
2. **Physician requests access** to patient records via smart contract.
3. **Patient grants or denies** access through an interface.
4. **If granted**, physician sees on-chain references and off-chain data pointers.
5. **Any access, interaction, or query**:
   - Triggers an event
   - Is scoped by hash
   - Is recorded immutably on-chain
6. **Researchers and agencies** operate under scoped, logged access with patient-governed constraints.

## 🔐 Blockchain + Off-Chain Strategy

Due to size limitations on-chain, Frankly uses a **hybrid architecture**:

- **On-chain**: 
  - Consent logs
  - Access control
  - Data hashes (fingerprints)
- **Off-chain**:
  - Images
  - Genomic files
  - Lab results

Files are referenced by their hash — proving they haven’t been tampered with.  
Consent scope itself is hashed, allowing on-chain validation without exposing raw intent.

## 🧪 Example: Consent-Based Data Access

1. Dr. Reyes wants to review Maria’s PET scan.
2. Dr. Reyes submits a smart contract request.
3. Maria is notified and grants access via UI.
4. The system logs a hash of the consent event on-chain.
5. Dr. Reyes receives access to the scan’s IPFS link, verified by hash.

## 📤 Exportable Architecture

Frankly was intentionally **overbuilt** to support multiple use cases:

- **Decentralized national EMR system**
- **Pharma-to-patient compliance tracking**
- **Clinical trials + supply chain audit**
- **Cross-border patient care**
- **Custom role-mapping framework for institution-specific actors (e.g. HR, billing)**

The repo is modular — adopters can strip it down to fit small clinics or scale it for national health systems.

## 🔄 Integration Points

- **Insurance API**
- **Pharmacy stock chain**
- **Genomic database**
- **Telemedicine**
